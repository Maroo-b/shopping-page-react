# shopping-page-react

## Description

This is a React application that demonstrates the use of React.useReducer for state management and component composition techniques to avoid props drilling.

The app features a simple shopping page with product and cart functionality, allowing users to:

Browse a list of products.
Add products to the cart.
Adjust quantities directly in the cart.
By leveraging useReducer, the app handles complex state transitions efficiently, while component composition ensures a clean and maintainable structure for passing data and actions without excessive prop drilling.

This project serves as an example of scalable React patterns for building interactive and stateful applications.
